     \class Camera
     \brief The Camera class defines the projection to apply to simulate a camera's position, orientation, and optics.
     \since 4.7
     \ingroup qt3d
     \ingroup qt3d::viewing

     \section1 Modelview and projection transformations

     A Camera instance is applied to the scene in two phases:
     modelview transformation and projection transformation.

     During the modelview transformation, the eye(), center(), and
     upVector() are used to generate a 4x4 transformation matrix that
     reflects the viewer's current position and orientation.

     During the projection transformation, the projectionType(),
     nearPlane(), farPlane(), fieldOfView(), and viewSize() are used
     to define a viewing volume as a 4x4 transformation matrix.

     The modelview transformation matrix is returned by modelViewMatrix().
     The projection transformation matrix is returned by projectionMatrix().

     \section1 Positioning and orienting the view

     The viewer position and orientation are defined by eye(), center(),
     and upVector().  The location of the viewer in world co-ordinates is
     given by eye(), the viewer is looking at the object of interest located
     at center(), and the upVector() specifies the direction that should
     be considered &quot;up&quot; with respect to the viewer.

     The vector from the eye() to the center() is called the &quot;view vector&quot;,
     and the cross-product of the view vector and upVector() is called
     the &quot;side vector&quot;.  The view vector specifies the direction the
     viewer is looking, and the side vector points off to the right of
     the viewer.

     It is recommended that the view vector and upVector() be at right angles
     to each other, but this is not required as long as the angle between
     them is close to 90 degrees.

     The most common use of view and up vectors that are not at right angles
     is to simulate a human eye at a specific height above the ground looking
     down at a lower object or up at a higher object.  In this case, the
     the view vector will not be true horizontal, but the upVector() indicating
     the human's upright stance will be true vertical.

     \section1 Zooming the camera image

     There are two ways to zoom the image seen through the camera: either
     the camera eye() position can be moved closer to the object of interest,
     or the field of view of the camera lens can be changed to make it appear
     as though the object is moving closer.

     Changing the eye() position changes the lighting calculation in the
     scene because the viewer is in a different position, changing the
     angle of light reflection on the object's surface.

     The setFieldOfView() function can be used to simulate the effect of a
     camera lens.  The smaller the fieldOfView(), the closer the object
     will appear.  The lighting calculation will be the same as for the
     unzoomed scene.

     If fieldOfView() is zero, then a standard perspective frustum of
     viewSize() is used to define the viewing volume.  The viewSize()
     can be adjusted with setViewSize() to zoom the view.  A smaller
     viewSize() will make the the object appear closer.

     The fieldOfView() or viewSize() is applied as part of the
     projectionMatrix().

     \section1 Rotating the viewer or object of interest

     Rotating a viewer in 3D space is a very delicate process.  It is very
     easy to construct the rotation incorrectly and end up in a &quot;gimbal lock&quot;
     state where further rotations are impossible in certain directions.

     To help alleviate this problem, Camera uses a quaternion-based
     approach to generate rotations.  A quaternion is a compact representation
     of a rotation in 3D space.  Rotations can be combined through quaternion
     multiplication.  More information on quaternions can be found in the
     documentation for QQuaternion.

     Before rotating the view, you should first decide the type
     of rotation you want to perform:

     \list
     \i Tilting or panning a fixed eye to reveal the scene in different
        directions and orientations.  This is equivalent to mounting a camera
        on a fixed tripod and then adjusting the direction of view and
        orientation with the tripod controls.
     \i Rotating a moving viewer about the object of interest.  This is
        equivalent to moving the viewer around the object at a fixed distance,
        but with the viewer always pointing at the object.
     \endlist

     In the Camera class, the first type of rotation is performed with
     rotateEye() and the second with rotateCenter().  Each of these functions
     take a quaternion argument that defines the type of rotation to perform.

     The tilt(), pan(), and roll() functions return values that can help with
     constructing the rotation quaternions to pass to rotateEye() and
     rotateCenter().  Tilt and pan are also known as &quot;pitch&quot; and &quot;yaw&quot; in
     flight dynamics.

     Three axes of rotation are used to compute the quaternions.  The tilt()
     quaternion is computed with respect to the side vector, the pan()
     quaterion is computed with respect to the upVector(), and the roll()
     quaternion is computed with respect to the view vector.

     The following example tilts the direction the eye() is pointing
     by 5 degrees, and then pans by 45 degrees:

     \code
     camera.rotateEye(camera.tilt(5));
     camera.rotateEye(camera.pan(45));
     \endcode

     The next example performs the two rotations in a single fluid step
     (note that the rotation to be performed first is multiplied last):

     \code
     camera.rotateEye(camera.pan(45) * camera.tilt(5));
     \endcode

     These two examples will not produce the same visual result, even though
     it looks like they might.  In the first example, the upVector() is tilted
     before the pan() quaternion is computed.  In the second example, the pan()
     quaternion is computed using the original upVector().

     This difference in behavior is useful in different situations.  Some
     applications may wish to perform all rotations relative to the original
     viewer orientation, and other applications may wish to perform rotations
     relative to the current viewer orientation.  These application types
     correspond to the second and first examples above.

     \section1 Moving the viewer or object of interest

     The simplest way to move the viewer or object of interest is to call
     setEye() or setCenter() respectively and supply a new position in
     world co-ordinates.  However, this can lead to non-intuitive movements
     if the viewer orientation is not aligned with the world co-ordinate axes.

     For example, subtracting 3 from the eye() x co-ordinate will appear to
     move the eye left 3 units if the viewer orientation is aligned with the
     world co-ordinate axes.  But it will not appear to move the eye left 3
     units in any other orientation.

     The translation() function can be used to construct a translation
     vector that is aligned with the viewer's current orientation.
     Movement in the x direction will move along the side vector, movement in
     the y direction will move along upVector(), and movement in the z
     direction will move along the view vector.

     The translation() function is useful when implementing operations such
     as &quot;step left&quot;, &quot;jump up&quot;, and so on where the movement should be
     interpreted relative to the viewer's current orientation, not the
     world co-ordinate axes,

     In other words, the following two lines of code are not equivalent
     unless the view is oriented with the world co-ordinate axes:

     \code
     camera.translateEye(camera.translation(x, y, z));

     camera.translateEye(QVector3D(x, y, z));
     \endcode

     The following example translates the eye() position while
     keeping the object of interest at the original center():

     \code
     camera.translateEye(camera.translation(x, y, z));
     \endcode

     The following example translates the object of interest at
     center() while keeping the eye() position fixed:

     \code
     camera.translateCenter(camera.translation(x, y, z));
     \endcode

     The following example translates both the eye() and the center()
     by the same amount, which will maintain the original view vector.

     \code
     QVector3D vector = camera.translation(x, y, z);
     camera.translateEye(vector);
     camera.translateCenter(vector);
     \endcode

     It is important that the translation vector for center() be computed
     before eye() is translated if both eye() and center() must move by the
     same amount.  The following code translates center() in the viewer
     orientation after the eye() is translated:

     \code
     camera.translateEye(camera.translation(x, y, z));
     camera.translateCenter(camera.translation(x, y, z));
     \endcode

     Translating both eye() and center() by the same amount can be used
     to simulate sliding a viewer past a scene while always looking in the
     same direction (for example, filming a scene from a moving vehicle).
     An alternative is to fix the viewer and move the scene itself:
     the negation of the translation() vector can be applied to the
     scene's modelview transformation.

     \section1 Motion tracking

     Viewing of 3D scenes can be enhanced if there is some way to track
     the motion of the viewer or the orientation of the display device.

     Applications can use setMotionAdjustment() to alter the position
     of the camera to account for the viewer's motion.  This indicates
     the viewer's position relative to the center of the screen.
     The motionAdjustment() vector is used to determine by how much
     the camera position should be adjusted.  The distance of the viewer
     from the screen is ignored.

     On handheld devices that use accelerometers to determine the
     orientation of the device, the down vector due to gravity
     can be adjusted to serve as a motion tracking vector.

     The output of motion tracking hardware can be very noisy,
     with minor fluctuations due to viewer twitch movements or
     environmental factors.  The application is responsible for
     cleaning up the signal and removing these fluctuations before
     setMotionAdjustment() is called.

     \property Camera::motionAdjustment
     \brief the adjustment vector to apply to the eye() for user motion.

     This property is typically used to implement motion tracking.
     It is interpreted as a vector from the center of the screen to the
     current position of the viewer.  The angle between the motion
     adjustment vector and the screen center is used to adjust the
     position of the eye() when apply() is called.

     The default value is (0, 0, 1), which indicates a viewer
     directly in front of the center of the screen.

     The units for the vector are unspecified.  They could be
     meters, centimeters, or the force due to gravity in various
     directions from an accelerometer.  The angle defined
     by the vector is used to perform the adjustment, not its
     magnitude.

     The output of motion tracking hardware can be very noisy,
     with minor fluctuations due to viewer twitch movements or
     environmental factors.  The application is responsible for
     cleaning up the signal and removing these fluctuations before
     altering this property.
